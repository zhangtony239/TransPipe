# 🧠 TransPipe: A Modular Semantic Routing Runtime for AI Agents

> ⚙️ Transforming Transformers into Structured, Explainable, and Scalable Reasoning Systems.

---

## 🌟 What is TransPipe?

**TransPipe** is a hybrid symbolic-neural runtime system that reimagines how large language models (LLMs) perform reasoning and task execution.  
It decouples the process of "thinking" from monolithic LLM inference by introducing an **explicit, modular, semantic routing pipeline** — allowing intelligent agents to plan, act, and adapt with efficiency, explainability, and composability.

---

## 🧭 Motivation

Modern LLM agents are powerful but **opaque**, **costly**, and **hard to control**.  
They suffer from:

- ❌ Uncontrollable black-box inference  
- ❌ High latency and compute costs  
- ❌ Lack of modularity and fallback logic  
- ❌ Poor adaptability across contexts

**TransPipe** proposes a different route:

- ✅ Explicit reasoning paths  
- ✅ Semantic route planning  
- ✅ Modular expert systems and fallback gates  
- ✅ CDN-style pipe and module distribution

---

## 🧱 Core Architecture

TransPipe consists of the following components:

| Component          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Trans (Side)**   | Training-time transformer that learns to generate and optimize semantic execution graphs (pipes). |
| **Pipe Graph**     | A symbolic execution plan composed of semantic modules (nodes) and routing decisions (edges). |
| **Execution Modules** | Specialized tools, LLMs, API wrappers, or sub-models that are activated selectively. |
| **Fallback Trans** | A general-purpose transformer that handles ambiguous, unseen, or failed routes (catch-all). |
| **Pipe CDN**       | A distributed module/pipe loader to enable edge-device execution and dynamic updates. |

## 🧪 Sample Use Cases

| Domain         | Application Example |
|----------------|---------------------|
| 🤖 AI Agent Automation | Multistep reasoning with fallback safety |
| 📚 AI Browsers         | Web summarization + tool routing + intent tracking |
| 🏭 Industrial Control  | Symbolic planning for PLC/robotics pipeline |
| 🧠 Assistants & Copilots | Dynamic context-aware task delegation |
| 📱 Edge AI Devices     | Cached pipes + low-cost execution modules |

## 🚧 Roadmap (2025)

### Q3-Q4 (Learning + Exploration Phase)

- [ ] Formalize semantic routing logic (pipe definition DSL)
- [ ] Build initial pipe executor (Python)
- [ ] Add dummy execution modules
- [ ] Integrate fallback GPT API
- [ ] Build CLI demo (agent that routes requests)
- [ ] Document system design (Whitepaper draft)
